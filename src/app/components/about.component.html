      The Cox Executive Forum is held every two years for Cox's senior leaders to align on strategy, set priorities, and celebrate success. We would be honored to have you join us as a sponsor of the 2018 Executive Forum. This exclusive sponsorship gives you a unique networking experience with an intimate group of Cox's senior executives while being inspired and motivated by A-list keynote speakers in a majestic location - The Monarch Beach Resort, Dana Point, California.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a part of the Executive Forum, we will be holding a Silent and Live Auction dinner benefitting the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This represents a special opportunity for each of us to make a charitable impact to a wonderful organization.
